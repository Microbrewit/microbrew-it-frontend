Microbrew.it Frontend
====================

This repository contains the web frontend for Microbrew.it.

## The Application
The Microbrew.it frontend is an Angular.js application that acts as a GUI for the Microbrew.it API.

## Installation
You need Node.js and NPM installled globally on your system.

Open a terminal instance and navigate to the cloned microbrew-it.frontend directory and run the following commands:

- ```npm install -g bower grunt-cli```

- ```cp microbrew-it.json-dist microbrew-it.json```

- ```npm install```

- ```bower install```

- ```grunt```

Microbrew.it should now build, and a node instance serving the frontend should be started at http://localhost:3000.
