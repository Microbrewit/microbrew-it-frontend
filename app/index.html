<!-- 
	Hello and welcone to the Microbrew.it frontend source code.

	You are looking at the index HTML. 

	If you are using Chrome or Firefox you'll be better off using the inspector, since most HTML is included dynamically.

	Depending on the build you can either find some reasonable CSS and Javascript files referenced,
	or, if you are unlucky, just some minified and uglified files.

	The raw source (Coffee, SASS, HTML + dependencies and Gruntfile) is available at:
	https://github.com/Microbrewit/microbrew-it-frontend
	
	I hope you enjoy your stay!
	- Torstein Thune, frontend guy.
